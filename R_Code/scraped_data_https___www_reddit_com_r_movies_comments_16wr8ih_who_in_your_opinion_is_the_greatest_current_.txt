    The title basically says it all. No right or wrong answers, I just want to hear people sound off on why their favorite director is their favorite director. Geek out about the films that made you love [insert your director here]. Is it the performances? The pacing? The look? The vibe?
  

    I’m currently rewatching Zodiac and it’s a shining example of why Fincher is among one of today’s greatest directors. Choosing not to show the initial killings because there was no witnesses to describe the scene, choosing a different actor for each Zodiac killing based on the description from the witnesses at that killing, etc etc. Zodiac, Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, The Social Network, etc…he’s made some of my all time favorite films.
